### 1. Overview
**Hub E** model is designed without a Network Firewall while ensuring that all incoming traffic is routed through the DMZ/Public Load Balancer public subnet. This approach allows the central network team to maintain control over traffic flow and enforce security using Security Lists, NSGs, and WAF (for HTTP/S traffic), while also managing and controlling East-West traffic communication between Spoke VCNs through DRG route tables.
It is recommended for environments where deep packet inspection is not a security requirement, as well as for proof-of-concept (PoC) deployments and Hub & Spoke architecture exploration.

### 2. Components
- VCN (Virtual Cloud Network)
- One regional public subnet (depicted in green)
    1. public-subnet for Public Load Balancers
- Three regional private subnets (depicted in dark-orange)
    1. private-subnet for management workloads
    2. private-subnet for monitoring and logs
    3. private-subnet for DNS (for OCI DNS resolver endpoints)
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Service Gateway
- Public Load Balancer (LBaaS)

&nbsp;

### 3. Specifications and Considerations
- Inbound traffic first enters the Public Load Balancer's public subnet and is then routed through the DRG to the respective LB's backends in the Spoke VCNs.
- Each Spoke VCN has its own NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.
- East-West traffic between Spoke VCNs is routed through the DRG.
